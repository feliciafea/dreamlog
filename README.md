# Dream Log

The Dream Log is a mobile application that allows users to record their dreams and store them in personally created accounts. The UI for this application is built using Flutter and Dart while the backend uses noSQL document database, Firestore. Firestore and the app's user-auth are supported by Firebase, Google's backend cloud computing services and application development platforms.
